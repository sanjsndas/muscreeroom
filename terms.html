                These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Dreamland, Earth, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Site, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Site.

                    MushCreeRoom provides kits for growing various types of mushrooms. While we strive to provide accurate and comprehensive instructions, successful cultivation depends on numerous factors, including environmental conditions, adherence to instructions, and individual care. We cannot guarantee specific growth rates, yields, or the complete absence of contaminants, as mycology involves complex biological processes. Users are responsible for understanding and adhering to local laws and regulations regarding the cultivation, possession, and consumption of any mushroom species. It is crucial to correctly identify any mushroom before consumption; misidentification can lead to serious health risks. MushCreeRoom explicitly disclaims any responsibility for adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products or the information provided on our site.
